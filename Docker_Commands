docker kill container_name: Forcefully stops a running container immediately without waiting for cleanup (sends SIGKILL signal)
docker rm container_name: Removes a stopped container from the system
docker rm container1 container2 container3: Removes multiple stopped containers at once (Make sure containers are stopped before running this command)
docker rm $(docker ps -a -q): Removes all containers (stopped or after stopping running ones) by passing their container IDs
docker container prune: Deletes all stopped containers after confirmation to free up disk space
docker ps -a: Lists all containers, including running, stopped, and exited ones, along with their status and details
docker start container_name: Starts a previously stopped container without recreating it
docker start container_1 container_2 container_3: Starts multiple stopped containers at once using their names or IDs
docker start $(docker ps -a -q): Starts all stopped containers by passing their container IDs
docker rename old_name new_name: Renames a container without stopping it. Useful for clarity or avoiding naming conflicts


docker rmi image_name: Removes Docker image from the local system. Containers using the image must be stopped/removed first
docker rmi image1 image2: Removes multiple Docker images at once. Images must not be used by running containers
docker rmi $(docker images -q): Removes all Docker images by passing their image IDs. Make sure no containers are using the images
docker image prune: Removes dangling (unused/overriden) images after confirmation


docker build -t image_name .: Builds a Docker image from the Dockerfile in the current directory and tags it with the given name
docker login: Used to authenticate your local Docker client with Docker Hub. Required before pushing images to the registry
docker tag <old_name> <new_name>: Used to rename or retag a Docker image. Commonly used before pushing images to Docker Hub
docker push image_name: Uploads the tagged Docker image from the local system to a remote Docker registry


docker inspect container_name: Displays detailed information about a Docker container in JSON format, including configuration, state, and network details
docker network ls: Lists all Docker networks (default and custom), showing their names, drivers, and scopes
docker network create network_name: Creates a new custom Docker network with the specified name, using the default bridge driver unless another driver is specified
docker network rm network_name: Removes the specified Docker network. The network must not have any connected containers; otherwise, the removal will fail
docker network prune: Removes all unused Docker networks that are not connected to any containers
docker network inspect network_name: Displays detailed information about the specified Docker network, including connected containers, IP address ranges, driver type, and network configuration
docker run -itd --name container --network network_name image_name: Creates a new container from the specified image, attaches it to the given Docker network
docker network connect network_name container_name: Connects an existing container to a specified Docker network without restarting the container


docker run -itd --name cont-1 -v /mydevops ubuntu: Creates a new container and mounts the host directory /mydevops into the container at the same path for persistent storage and data sharing
docker run -itd --name cont-2 --privileged=true --volumes-from cont-1 ubuntu: Creates a new container, grants it extended privileges, and mounts all volumes from cont-1, allowing both to share the same data volumes
docker volume ls: Lists all Docker volumes, showing their names and associated drivers
docker volume rm volume_name: Removes the specified Docker volume. The volume must not be in use by any containers; otherwise, the removal will fail
docker volume rm volume1 volume2: Removes multiple specified Docker volumes at once, provided that none of them are currently in use by any containers
docker volume prune: Removes all unused Docker volumes that are not referenced by any containers
docker volume inspect volume_name: Displays detailed information about the specified Docker volume, including its mount point, driver, labels, and usage details
