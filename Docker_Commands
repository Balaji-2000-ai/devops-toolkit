docker stop container_1 container_2 container_3: Gracefully stops multiple running containers at once by sending a SIGTERM signal to each
docker stop $(docker ps -q): Stops all currently running containers by passing their container IDs
docker kill container_name: Forcefully stops a running container immediately without waiting for cleanup (sends SIGKILL signal)
docker rm container_name: Removes a stopped container from the system
docker rm container1 container2 container3: Removes multiple stopped containers at once (Make sure containers are stopped before running this command)
docker rm $(docker ps -a -q): Removes all containers (stopped or after stopping running ones) by passing their container IDs
docker container prune: Deletes all stopped containers after confirmation to free up disk space

docker rmi $(docker images -q): Removes all Docker images by passing their image IDs. Make sure no containers are using the images
docker image prune: Removes dangling (unused/overriden) images after confirmation
